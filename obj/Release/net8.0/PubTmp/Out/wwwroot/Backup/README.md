Summary:

This is a web app to help the business development team to effectively handle every RSA account that is coming from online registration platform and via fund fusion app.

The functionality where during login, the team leads can login and access all online RSA registered accounts, and they are allowed to assign and reassign the accounts to the Business Development officers for follow-up, and also contact the customers if any document submitted on the online platform is not correct.

What is their problem?
1.	The BD Team currently do not have a way to assign account managers to newly registered accounts.
2.	Team leads do not have a way to reassign and reshuffle accounts previously assigned because of staff exit or customer/staff relocation or growth of pension fund.
3.	Account Managers do not have a repo of all their accounts online.
4.	Account managers do not have a place to track their engagement with Customers.
5.	Head BDM and Team leads do not currently have a way to track follow-up of customers.
6.	There is no way to track new accounts registered online or via fund fusion that have not been assigned to an account manager.

Tech and Tools
We will be building this app with HTML, VSCode, CSS and JavaScript. As we progress, we will make decisions about package management, data storage, and authentication, likely incorporating Vite and Firebase. Presently there is no project setup that is required before adding to the codebase.
